# Virtual Threads vs. Platform Threads: A Detailed Comparison

Virtual threads represent a significant shift in Java concurrency, offering a lightweight alternative to traditional platform threads. Understanding the distinctions between these two types of threads is crucial for leveraging the benefits of virtual threads and making informed decisions about concurrency in your Java applications.

This lesson will delve into a detailed comparison of virtual threads and platform threads, covering their characteristics, resource consumption, scheduling, and suitability for different workloads. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of when and why to choose virtual threads over platform threads.

## Core Differences: Virtual Threads vs. Platform Threads

The fundamental difference lies in how these threads are managed by the operating system and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Platform Threads

- **Mapping**: Platform threads are directly mapped to operating system (OS) threads (kernel threads). Each platform thread corresponds to a native thread in the underlying OS.
- **Resource Consumption**: Because they are backed by OS threads, platform threads consume significant system resources, including memory (stack size) and kernel resources. Creating a large number of platform threads can lead to resource exhaustion and performance degradation.
- **Context Switching**: Context switching between platform threads is managed by the OS scheduler, which involves significant overhead. This overhead includes saving and restoring the thread's execution context, which can be a costly operation, especially when there are frequent context switches.
- **Number**: The number of platform threads that can be created is limited by the OS and hardware resources. Typically, this limit is in the hundreds or low thousands.
- **Blocking Operations**: When a platform thread blocks (e.g., waiting for I/O), the underlying OS thread is blocked, preventing it from doing any other work. This can lead to inefficient resource utilization, especially in I/O-bound applications.

### Virtual Threads

- **Mapping**: Virtual threads are managed by the JVM and are not directly mapped to OS threads. Instead, many virtual threads can be multiplexed onto a smaller number of platform threads, which are referred to as carrier threads.
- **Resource Consumption**: Virtual threads are lightweight and consume significantly fewer resources than platform threads. They have a smaller memory footprint and do not require dedicated kernel resources. This allows you to create millions of virtual threads without exhausting system resources.
- **Context Switching**: Context switching between virtual threads is managed by the JVM, which is much faster than OS-level context switching. The JVM can quickly switch between virtual threads without involving the OS scheduler, reducing overhead and improving performance.
- **Number**: You can create a very large number of virtual threads (millions) because they are lightweight and managed by the JVM.
- **Blocking Operations**: When a virtual thread blocks, the JVM can unmount it from its carrier thread, allowing the carrier thread to be used by another virtual thread. This prevents the carrier thread from being blocked and improves resource utilization. When the blocking operation completes, the virtual thread is remounted onto a carrier thread and resumes execution. This unmounting and remounting is handled by the ForkJoinPool scheduler (which will be discussed in more detail in Module 2).

## Resource Consumption: A Detailed Look

The difference in resource consumption is one of the most significant advantages of virtual threads.

### Memory Footprint

- **Platform Threads**: Each platform thread typically has a stack size of 1MB (this can vary depending on the OS and JVM configuration). This memory is reserved for the thread's execution stack, even if it's not fully utilized.
- **Virtual Threads**: Virtual threads have a much smaller initial stack size, typically a few kilobytes. The stack can grow dynamically as needed, but it starts small, reducing the overall memory footprint.

**Example:**

- Platform threads: 1,000 threads × 1MB = ~1GB memory usage
- Virtual threads: 1,000 threads = few megabytes (initial footprint)

### Kernel Resources

- **Platform Threads**: Each platform thread requires a corresponding kernel thread, which consumes kernel resources such as thread control blocks and scheduling data structures.
- **Virtual Threads**: Virtual threads do not require dedicated kernel resources. They are managed by the JVM and multiplexed onto a smaller number of carrier threads, reducing the load on the OS kernel.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**

- A web server using platform threads may run into system resource limits handling thousands of requests.
- A web server using virtual threads can handle millions of concurrent tasks efficiently.

## Scheduling and Context Switching

### Platform Threads

- **Scheduling**: Scheduled by the OS using preemptive scheduling.
- **Context Switching**: Costly due to saving/loading thread state, CPU registers, memory mappings.

### Virtual Threads

- **Scheduling**: Managed by JVM's ForkJoinPool using work-stealing algorithm.
- **Context Switching**: Lightweight and fast because JVM avoids kernel-level overhead.

**Real-World Example:**

- Platform threads: switches occur every few milliseconds → CPU underutilization.
- Virtual threads: switches occur every few microseconds → high efficiency.

## Blocking Operations: The Key to Scalability

### Platform Threads

- **Blocking**: Blocks the underlying OS thread, leading to inefficiency.

### Virtual Threads

- **Blocking**: JVM unmounts blocked thread, allowing carrier to serve other threads.

**Scenario:**

- Platform thread blocked on DB call = wasted OS thread.
- Virtual thread blocked on DB call = JVM unmounts/remounts → better utilization.

## Practical Examples and Demonstrations

### Example 1: Simple Task Execution

```java
// Platform Thread Example
Runnable platformTask = () -> {
    System.out.println("Platform thread executing: " + Thread.currentThread());
    try {
        Thread.sleep(100);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
};

Thread platformThread = new Thread(platformTask);
platformThread.start();

// Virtual Thread Example
Runnable virtualTask = () -> {
    System.out.println("Virtual thread executing: " + Thread.currentThread());
    try {
        Thread.sleep(100);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
};

Thread virtualThread = Thread.startVirtualThread(virtualTask);
```

### Example 2: Creating a Large Number of Threads

```java
int numberOfThreads = 1000;

// Platform Threads
for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        System.out.println("Platform thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }).start();
}

// Virtual Threads
for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
    Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
        System.out.println("Virtual thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    });
}
```

### Example 3: Blocking I/O Operation

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

public class BlockingIOExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
            try {
                HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
                HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                        .uri(URI.create("https://www.example.com"))
                        .build();

                HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
                System.out.println("Response from example.com: " + response.statusCode());
            } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        System.out.println("Main thread continues...");
        Thread.sleep(500);
    }
}
```
